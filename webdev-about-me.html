        <h2>Coding Interest</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>My journey into coding started with learning HTML5 and CSS through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">codeacademy</a> to a basic level of proficiency. Once I felt I had an understanding of the basics I enrolled in a bootcamp through <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> to allow me to create this website! I have enjoyed the challenges of learning how to code and the troubleshooting required to solve coding issues.</li>
                <li>I did not use any framework to create this website as I wanted to face the challenges of learning formating and spacing a website using CSS. From these challenges I have learned the importance of using class selectors effectvely and the importance of using resources such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> to check formatting, syntax and best practices.  </li>
                <li>Moving on from HTML and CSS I will be looking into learning JavaScript and Python in Web Development, so this will be my main focus for the next several months so I can really flesh out my website and have skills that are marketable in the industry.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Utilize my background in research along with the new coding skills I will acquire to pursue a position as a Jr Web Developer.</li>
                <li>Currently my interest is in front-end web development but I am open to the idea of learning some back-end languages and processes so that I could become a full-stack web developer.</li>
                <li>I plan to work on my portfolio to upload one new project every week so I can show off my work and any new skills I have acquired.</li>
            </ol>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>I am not a CS major but since I am moving into the tech sector I understand there is a gap in knowledge so to close that gap I found a resource called <a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">Teach Yourself Computer Science</a> where I have been teaching myself on the various subjects of Computer Science.</li>
                <li>In my free time I really enjoy immersing myself into the world of <a href="https://www.stalker-game.com/" target="_blank">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</a>, which is a horror FPS game that takes place after the Chernobyl disaster where the world has been plagued with monsters, radiation and supernatural events. The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games heavily reference Eastern European lifestyle, folklore, politics and much more to really make you feel immersed into the world.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check out the movie that started it all! <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079944/" target="_blank">Stalker(1979)</a></li>
                    <li>Link to a youtube video of the ingame radio(my favorite part) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rVj-3NIeQk" target="_blank">Radio</a></li>
